# Favourite Movies- Team Project for Telerik Android Course


On App start you see the most popular movies currently taken from the themoviedb.org. You navigate the pivot using swipe, fling or tap. If you want to turn on/off the music, just shake the device! When you click on a movie poster, you can see more details about the movie, see trailers through youtube and reviews and most importantly add it to your favourites. You can then see all your favourites in the Favourites tab.
